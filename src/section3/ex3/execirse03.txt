Create a class ScreenText, to display a certain text in specified screen coordinates. It must have a constructor which will receive X, Y and the string to write. It must also have 3 setters and a "Display" method.

Create a class CenteredText, based on ScreenText, to display text centered (horizontally) in a certain row of the screen. Its constructor will receive only Y and the text. SetX should not change the horizontal position.

Create a class FramedText, to display text centered and inside a rectangle. It will receive the starting row and the text.

Finally, create a test program for all of them, which will create an object of each type and display them.
