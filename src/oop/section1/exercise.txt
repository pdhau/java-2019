4) Method named setSecondNumber with one parameter of type double, it need set value of the secondNumber fields
5) Method named getAdditionResult without any parameters, it needs to return result of adding the filed values of
firstNumber and secondNumber
6) Method named getSubtractionResult without any parameters, it needs to return result of subtracting the filed values of
   firstNumber and secondNumber
7) Method named getMultiplicationResult without any parameters, it needs to return result of multiplying the filed values of
   firstNumber and secondNumber
8) Method named getDivisionResult without any parameters, it needs to return result of diving the filed values of
   firstNumber and secondNumber
9) Create static variable with name is counter to count for each execute  these method : getAdditionResult, getMultiplicationResult
, getMultiplicationResult, getDivisionResult counter variable will be increase 1
10) Method static getCount without any parameter to display value of counter variable.
